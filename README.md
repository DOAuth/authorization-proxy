# Authorization Proxy

Authorization Proxy (AP) is an interface to convey requests and responses to Authorization Blockchain in DOAuth.
I implemented AP with reference to some [OAuth 2.0](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) Authorization Server projects: [authorizationserver](https://github.com/andifalk/authorizationserver), [oauth-in-action-code](https://github.com/oauthinaction/oauth-in-action-code), and so on.
